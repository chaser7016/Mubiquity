## Synopsis

Mubiquity (Music Everywhere)
A responsive music web app - powered by SoundCloud

## Motivation

This app and any other apps posted here on my GitHub are solely for the purpose of increasing my Javascript skills, learning/playing with the latest frameworks and to overall keep my skills on the cutting-edge.  Also, to solve problems like not being able to easily share songs on mobile devices, which this app solves.
